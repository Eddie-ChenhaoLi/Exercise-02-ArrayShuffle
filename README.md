### Exercise-02-ArrayShuffle
Write a program to shuffle an array.

Start by writing a function which will accept two integer arguments (min,max) and generate an array between min and max where:  
  o) min is an inclusive lower bound  
  o) max is an exclusive upper bound  
For example (1,7) should generate random integers as {1,2,3,4,5,6}.  
Then shuffle the array.
